Today, I successfully completed the Terminal Scavenger Hunt challenge, an experience that tested both my problem-solving skills and my paitence.
It was a journey filled with commands, dictories, hidden files, and the eventual reward od seeing the message: "I AM A TERMINSL MASTER."

The challenge began with navigating through a series of dictories using the terminal.
I had to familirize myself with basic commands such as as cd to change dictories, ls to list files, and Get-Location to confirm my current directory, in PowerShell.
Transitioning from Ubuntu commands to PowerShell was a unique challenge on its own, requiring me to adapt and learn new syntax.

One of the more difficult moments came when I encountered a zip file named final_treausure.zip within the .final_challenge directory. 
Extracting it was a bit tricky because I was unsure of the correct PowerShell command.
However, I discovered that Expand-Archive is the equivelant od unzip in Ubuntu. 
Using the command Expand-Archive -Path final -final_treausure.zip -DestinationPath . successfully extracted the contents.

Upon extraction, I found victory_message.txt.
Opening this file revealed the triumphant message that validated all my efforts: "I AM A TERMINAL MASTER."
It was a fulfilling moment, knowing that all the navigation, commands, and problem-solving led to this success.

I also encountered a minor confusin when i attempted to open final_clue.txt, only to realize that the file did not exist. 
It was a good reminder that attention to detail and proper verification are key when working wit the command line.

The experience taught me the importance of persistance, resourcefulness, and the value of understanding the tools at my disposal.
It streng my familiarity with terminal navigation, file management, and the differences between Ubuntu and PowerShell environments.

Overall, completing the Terminal Scavenger Hunt has boosted my confidence in using the Terminal and PowerShell.
I am proud to call myself a Terminal Master.
